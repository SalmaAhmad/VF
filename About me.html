      <p id="all_about_me">This Program was the first time i got to experience web development, i applied because i'v always been intrested in coding and i wanted to experience the satisfaction of developing and designing my own website.My first website is related to travelling because travelling abroad means the world to me and i also wanted to make sure that anyone who went through this website knows about all these beautiful underrated locations.However,I also enjoy all kinds of sports
      (anything that envolves physical effort pretty much). I'v practised atleast 10 different sports and i think it's safe to say that i'm a sportaholic!</p>
